# Semantic Course Material Search
This project enables semantic search over educational content including lectures, code assignments, etc., by:
*  processing course materials into searchable and comparable chuns,
*  embedding content using Google Gemini's AI models,
*  storing vectors in ChromaDB for fast retrieval,
*  querying with natural language.
