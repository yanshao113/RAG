# Semantic Course Material Search
This project implements an **AI-powered semantic search system** for educational content including lectures, code assignments, etc., which dramatically reduces search time and improves learning efficiency by:
*  **processing** diverse course materials into context-preserving chunks
*  **embedding** content using Google Gemini's models
*  **storing** vectors in ChromaDB for fast retrieval
*  **querying** with natural language
